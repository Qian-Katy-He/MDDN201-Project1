				<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. In practice, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved. As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.</p>

				<p>A search engine is software accessed on the Internet that searches a database of information according to the user's query. The engine provides a list of results that best match what the user is trying to find. Today, there are many different search engines available on the Internet, each with its own abilities and features. The first search engine ever developed is considered Archie, which was used to search for FTP files, and the first text-based search engine is considered Veronica. citur massa.

				<p>Broadband is high-speed internet access. Itâ€™s a service first delivered by the copper network across New Zealand - the very same network that connects our phone lines. In 2011, we started working with the Government to introduce a newer technology, fibre, to build an ultra-fast broadband (UFB) network that has faster speeds and more capacity, creating a platform that has the ability to transform the way we live, socialise, work and play. While fibre is the future of broadband in New Zealand, you can also access the Internet over a copper, wireless or satellite connection.i.</p>
